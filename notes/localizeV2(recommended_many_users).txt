in CMD (command prompt)
1. Find Your Server’s Local IP Address
- ipconfig
- sample -  IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.100

2. Configure Apache to Accept Connections

<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Require local
</Directory>
- change from Require local to Require all granted
3. Restart Apache Server

4. Test Connection From Client Devices
- Make sure client devices (mobile, desktop) are connected to the same local network (same WiFi or wired LAN).
- Open a browser on the client device.
- Enter the server IP in the address bar, e.g.:
http://192.168.1.100/systempos/login.php

Troubleshooting
- Make sure the server’s firewall is allowing incoming connections on port 80.
- To test if the port is open, you can use apps like Ping or Telnet on client devices.
- If needed, add firewall rules on your server:
On Windows:
Go to Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced settings > Inbound Rules > New Rule, allow TCP port 80.
